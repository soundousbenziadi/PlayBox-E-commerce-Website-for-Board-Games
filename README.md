# PlayBox-E-commerce-Website-for-Board-Games

PlayBox is a **desktop-only** e-commerce website created as a university project for the **DAW (Development of Web Applications)** module. The website simulates a platform for browsing and purchasing board games online.

This project followed strict academic constraints:

- ❌ No Flexbox or CSS Grid
- ❌ No `<div>` elements
- ❌ No external frameworks (Bootstrap, etc.)
- ✅ All layout is built using HTML `<table>` elements

Despite these limitations, PlayBox offers core e-commerce features using only basic web technologies.
